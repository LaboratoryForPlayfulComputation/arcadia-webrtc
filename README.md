If you'd like to start your own editor, fork this repo and fix all the TODOs.

## TODOs

- [ ] Fork repo and setup local server (see below)
- [ ] Update metadata in ``pxtarget.json``. Change the id, title, name, etc... to your taste.
- [ ] Update the JavaScript runtime in ``sim/simulator.ts``. If needed add additional JS library under ``sim/public/**``
and edit ``sim/public/simulator.html`` with additional ``script`` tags.
- [ ] Update the APIs in ``sim/api.ts`` to use your runtime.
- [ ] Test your editor in the local server
- [ ] run ``pgk staticpkg --gh --bump`` to upload a static version to GitHub pages.
